Temperature Monitoring and Control System
This is a Raspberry Pi-based temperature monitoring and control system that uses various GPIO components to manage temperature-related tasks.

Features
Temperature Monitoring: The system continuously monitors the temperature and takes appropriate actions based on the readings.
Temperature Thresholds: The system has the following temperature thresholds:
Normal range: 30°C to 40°C
High temperature: Above 40°C
System States:
Entry Idle State: The system is turned off and waiting for user input.
Stay Idle State: The system is in idle mode, waiting for the "Start System" button to be pressed.
Entry Monitoring Temp State: The system is enabled and ready to monitor the temperature.
Stay Monitoring Temp State: The system is actively monitoring the temperature.
Temp High State: The temperature is in the high range (30°C to 40°C), and the ventilation system is activated.
Emergency State: The temperature is above 40°C, and the emergency alert is triggered.
User Controls:
"Start System" button: Starts the temperature monitoring process.
"Reset System" button: Resets the system to the Entry Idle State.
Graphical Interface: The system uses the TkCircuit library to provide a graphical interface for visualizing the components and system state.
Hardware Components
Raspberry Pi
LEDs (System On LED, Emergency LED)
Buttons (Start System, Reset System)
Buzzer
Servo Motor (for ventilation control)
Temperature Sensor (simulated using random values)
How to Run the Program
Install the required libraries:
pip install tkgpio gpiozero
Save the provided code in a file (e.g., temperature_system.py).
Run the program:
python temperature_system.py
Customization
You can customize the system by modifying the configuration dictionary in the code. This includes changing the position, name, and pin assignments for the various components.

Future Improvements
Integrate a real temperature sensor (e.g., MCP3008 ADC) for accurate temperature readings.
Add more sophisticated temperature control mechanisms, such as temperature-based fan speed control.
Implement logging and data visualization features for monitoring the system's performance over time.
Explore integration with cloud-based platforms or home automation systems.
